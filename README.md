We would like to create an exam attempt marker.
Exams questions can be of multiple types, such as: one that requires a single numerical value as its answer, one that requires a either 'yes' or 'no' as its answer, or a multiple choice question which requires one or more of its options to be selected.
An exam attempt is marked using a mark scheme, which is a special version of an exam attempt in which each question's answer is set to its correct value, and the total possible mark for the question set to its maximum.
Marking an exam attempt awards a mark, out of the total number possible, for each question.
Then, the sum of the mark awarded for each question is calculated to give a total mark for the attempt, out of the total possible for the exam.
Finally, the attempt's total mark is converted to a degree classification; either 1.1, 2.1, 2.2 or 0.0.

Print the total mark awarded for the entire attempt. Then, convert this total to a classification and print this classification, using the following grade boundaries:
A mark of at least 9 is awarded a classification of 1.1.
A mark that is lower than the previous boundary, but is at least 7 is awarded a classification of 2.1.
A mark that is lower than the previous boundary, but is at least 6 is awarded a classification of 2.2.
A mark lower than the previous boundary is awarded a classification of 0.0.
